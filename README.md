#👋 Hi! I'm **Chris**

My full name is **Endryos Christopher**, but seriously… just call me **Chris** (I like it this way XD). I'm **17 years old**, and this is where I keep my projects, my crazy ideas, and my evolution as a programmer.

## 🌟My Story

I started programming with a simple but strong purpose: **to change the world in some way**. It may sound cliché, I know, but it's real. I always wanted to create things that:

* make people's lives easier,
* bring excitement and joy,
* help those in need,
* and make someone look and think: *"Wow, that was useful to me."*

Since I was little I've always enjoyed technology, but it was only when I started a program that I felt I could really **create** something from scratch — something that makes a difference.

## 💻 What you'll find here

My GitHub has a little bit of everything:

* Experimental projects
* Scripts and tools
* Things I made just to learn
* Others I made because I had an idea and wanted to share it
* And several projects in progress (because, you know, devs live on eternal drafts 😂)

My current focus is **Roblox Studio**, **Lua**, gameplay animation, and intelligent systems within games, but I'm always exploring other areas.

## 🎯 Goal

I don't just want to "write code." I want to create **experiences**, **ideas**, **solutions**. I want to evolve with each project.

If one day someone uses something of mine and smiles, it will all have been worth it.

## 🚀 Technologies and areas I enjoy

* Lua/Roblox Studio
* In-game systems programming
* Character movement intelligence
